Paintless dent repair (PDR) is the preferred option when your paint is intact. Using precision tools, a technician reshapes the metal from behind the panel. The result is a smooth finish without repainting.

## When PDR is a great fit

- Door dings from parking lots
- Hail dents across hoods and roofs
- Minor collision dents where the paint surface is undamaged

## What impacts pricing

Repair cost depends on dent size, location, and accessibility. Multi-panel hail damage is priced by the number of dents and the overall complexity. Clear photos help us provide a fast estimate.

## Typical repair timelines

Most door ding repairs can be completed in a few hours. Hail damage varies by severity and panel count, but we keep scheduling transparent so you can plan ahead.
